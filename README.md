## Overview

This project is designed as an assessment for mobile developers. It includes:

- **User Authentication:**  
  Secure login and registration using email and password with local session storage.
  
- **Dynamic Dashboard:**  
  A product listing fetched dynamically from a mock API and displayed in a refined grid layout.
  
- **Product Details:**  
  Detailed view for each product with images, price, and description.
  
- **Logout Functionality:**  
  Securely clears user sessions and navigates back to the login screen.

The app is fully functional on both Android and iOS.

Approach
---
This project follows a modular approach to separate concerns and enhance maintainability:
---
State Management:
---
Uses Provider to inject and manage state across the application.
---
Reactive updates ensure the UI stays in sync with the authentication state and product data.
---
API Integration:
---
Utilizes the http package to asynchronously fetch product data from the Fake Store API.
---
Implements JSON parsing to convert API responses into Dart objects.
---
Local Persistence:
---
Implements SQFLite to manage local storage of user data.
---
Uses SharedPreferences to persist authentication tokens between app launches.
---
Navigation:
---
Leverages Flutterâ€™s routing system to navigate between screens (login, register, home, detail).
---
Incorporates hero animations for smooth transitions between the product list and detail screens.
---
Modular Architecture:
---
The codebase is organized into clear, distinct folders for models, providers, screens, and services.
---
This separation allows for easy scalability and maintenance.
